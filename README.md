This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
./dev.sh
```

## Considerations

- assumed only 20 rows
- no tests have been written
- storing data in localstorage and using broadcast channel to make sure tabs are in sync
